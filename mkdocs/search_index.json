Please update your API client as soon as possible.\n\n\nRefer to the \nUsing the API > Request Format\n section below for further details.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome! All up-to-date documentation of Pardot's official API is housed here. A few things of note:\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a question about the API, feel free to \nopen a ticket\n with our Support team.\n\n\nTo report an inconsistency in the documentation, please \nopen an issue on GitHub\n. \nPull requests\n are welcome as well!\n\n\nIf you've written your own library or wrapper for Pardot's API, submit a \npull request\n updating the \nindex.md\n file with a link to your repository, and we'll be glad to consider linking it up.\n\n\nFor the latest information on updates to the API and related documentation, refer to the \nRelease Notes\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the API\n\n\nThe Pardot API allows your application to access current data within Pardot. Through the API, several common operations can be performed on Pardot objects. Operations include:\n\n\n\n\ncreate\n -- Creates a new object with the specified parameters.\n\n\nread\n -- Retrieves information about the specified object.\n\n\nquery\n -- Retrieves objects that match specified criteria.\n\n\nupdate\n -- Updates elements of an existing object.\n\n\nupsert\n -- Updates elements of an existing object if it exists.  If the object does not exist, one is created using the supplied parameters.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers must authenticate with the API before issuing requests.  Refer to the \nAuthentication\n section for details about this procedure.\n\n\nSome considerations must be taken while performing requests. When performing \nupdate\n requests, only the fields specified in the request are updated, and all others are left unchanged. If a required field is cleared during an \nupdate\n, the request will be declined.\n\n\nRequest Format\n\n\nAll requests to the API:\n\n\n\n\nMust use either HTTP \nGET\n or \nPOST\n\n\nMust pass credentials in an HTTP \nAuthorization\n header - or - in the body of a \nPOST\n request\n\n\n\n\nSample GET Request\n\n\nGET https://pi.pardot.com/api/<object>/version/3/do/<op>/<id_field>/<id>?<params> HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Pardot api_key=<your_api_key>, user_key=<your_user_key>\n\n\n\n\nSample POST Request\n\n\nPOST https://pi.pardot.com/api/<object>/version/3/do/<op>/<id_field>/<id> HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Pardot api_key=<your_api_key>, user_key=<your_user_key>\n\n<params>\n\n\n\n\nRequest Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobject\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe object type to be returned by the API request\n\n\n\n\n\n\nop\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe operation to be performed on the specified object type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_field\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe field to be used as the identifier for the specified object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe identifier for the specified object(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour_api_key\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe API key that was obtained during \nAuthentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour_user_key\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe user key that was used during \nAuthentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nformat\n\n\n\n\nThe API data format. Either xml or json (xml is default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparams\n\n\n\n\nParameters specific to your request; See individual methods for details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ordering of parameters is arbitrary. Parameters are passed using conventional HTML parameter syntax, with \n'?'\n indicating the start of the parameter string (for GET requests only) and \n'&'\n as the separator between parameters. With the exception of \n<format>\n and \n<params>\n, all components are required. Data returned from the API is formatted using JSON or XML 1.0 with UTF-8 character encoding. Keep in mind that some characters in the response may be encoded as HTML entities, requiring client-side decoding. Also, keep in mind that all parameters specified in an API request MUST be URL-encoded before they are submitted.\n\n\nIn general, the API will return XML or JSON containing a current version of the target object's data. However, unsuccessful requests will return a short response containing an error code and message. See \nError Codes & Messages\n for error descriptions and suggested remedies.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3 and Version 4 differences\n\n\nIn order to accommodate a new feature related to prospects,\nwe have created a new version of our APIs - version 4.\nWe are now allowing multiple prospects to share an email address on some Pardot accounts.\nEventually this will be available for all Pardot accounts.\nIf your account has this feature active now, then you MUST use version 4.\nEveryone else can continue using version 3.\nVersion 4 may use slightly different input syntax where prospects are involved,\nand may return multiple prospects where version 3 returned one.\nPlease check out the appropriate version's documentation for more exact usage details.\n\n\nIf your account uses v4, then upon login to the APIs,\na data tag will be returned as such: \n<version>4</version>\n.\nIf your account requires version 3, you will not see this tag.\n\n\nChanging the API Response Format\n\n\nThe Pardot API supports several output formats, each of which returns different levels of detail in the XML or JSON response. Output formats are defined by specifying the \noutput\n request parameter. Supported output formats include:\n\n\n\n\nfull\n -- Returns all supported data for the Pardot object and all objects associated with it.\n\n\nsimple\n -- Returns all supported data for the data for the Pardot object.\n\n\nmobile\n -- Returns an abbreviated version of the object data. This output format is ideal for mobile applications.\n\n\nbulk\n -- Returns basic data for an object (does not provide total object count). Used for querying \nlarge amounts of data\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf the output request parameter is not defined, the output format defaults to \nfull\n. See the XML Response Format sections for each object for details about the formats.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nRequest Format\n\n\nAuthentication requests sent to the Pardot API:\n\n\n\n\nMust be made via SSL encrypted connection\n\n\nMust use HTTP \nPOST\n\n\nMust contain the \nemail\n, \npassword\n, and \nuser_key\n for the Pardot user account that will be submitting API requests\n\n\n\n\nLogin requests that meet these criteria will be granted an API key.\n\n\nAPI user keys are available in Pardot under \n{your email address} > Settings\n in the API User Key row. If you need assistance in acquiring your user key, contact your Pardot support representative.\n\n\nIn accounts with \nSalesforce User Sync enabled\n, you must authenticate with a Pardot-only user. SSO users aren't supported.\n\n\n\n\nBoth User and API keys are unique to individual users. API keys are valid for 60 minutes. In contrast, user keys are valid indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nSample POST Request\n\n\nPOST https://pi.pardot.com/api/login/version/3 HTTP/1.1\n\nemail=<email>&password=<password>&user_key=<user_key>\n\n\n\n\nRequest Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe email address of your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe password of your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_key\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe 32-character hexadecimal user key for your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf authentication was successful, a 32-character hexadecimal API key will be returned in the following format:\n\n\n<rsp stat=\"ok\" version=\"1.0\">\n    <api_key>5a1698a233e73d7c8ccd60d775fbc68a</api_key>\n</rsp>\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the response will contain the following:\n\n\n<rsp stat=\"fail\" version=\"1.0\">\n    <err code=\"15\">Login failed</err>\n</rsp>\n\n\n\n\nSubsequent authentication requests will return either the current valid API key or a newly generated API key if the previous one had expired.\n\n\nRate Limits\n\n\nWe enforce API rate limits in two ways:\n\n\n\n\ndaily requests\n\n\nconcurrent requests\n\n\n\n\nDaily Requests\n\n\nPardot Pro customers are allocated 25,000 API requests per day. Pardot Ultimate customers can make up to 100,000 API requests a day.\nThese limits reset at the beginning of the day based on your accounts time zone settings. Any request made exceeding the\nlimits will result in an \nerror code 122\n\n\nYou can check you current daily usages in the accounts \"usage and limits\" page.\n\n\nConcurrent Requests\n\n\nIn order to interact with our API more efficiently, you can have up to five concurrent API requests. Any connection over five\nwill result in an \nerror code 66\n response.\n\n\nSample Code\n\n\nHere's an example of calling the Pardot API using a simple PHP function and the cURL library.\n\n\nNote: we strongly recommend \nagainst\n using PHP's \nfile_get_contents\n function to call the Pardot API, since it makes error handling extremely cumbersome.\n\n\n/**\n * Call the Pardot API and get the raw XML response back\n *\n * @param string $url the full Pardot API URL to call, e.g. \"https://pi.pardot.com/api/prospect/version/3/do/query\"\n * @param array $data the data to send to the API\n * @param string $method the HTTP method, one of \"GET\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\"\n * @param array $headers array of headers to send to the API - make sure to include your Authorization: header with your api_key and user_key\n * @return string the raw XML response from the Pardot API\n * @throws Exception if we were unable to contact the Pardot API or something went wrong\n */\nfunction callPardotApi($url, $data, $method = 'GET', $headers = null)\n{\n    // build out the full url, with the query string attached.\n    $queryString = http_build_query($data, null, '&');\n    if (strpos($url, '?') !== false) {\n        $url = $url .

            "text": "Bulk Data Pull via the Pardot API\n\n\nThis document outlines the approach and best practices around pulling a large amount of data out of Pardot via the API, typically for ingestion into a third-party system or internal data warehouse.\n\n\nPulling data from Pardot is a straightforward, two-step process. First, log in with your Pardot user email, password, and user key to acquire an API key. Then, use the query endpoint for each data set to pull the data.\n\n\nQuery the Pardot API\n\n\nBefore getting started, review the documentation at http://developer.pardot.com and determine which data set you are going to pull. For a data set to be eligible for a bulk data pull, it must have a query operation that supports at least one of the following three sets of search filter criteria parameters:\n\n\n\n\ncreated_before\n and \ncreated_after\n\n\nupdated_before\n and \nupdated_after\n\n\nid_greater_than\n and \nid_less_than\n\n\n\n\nIssue an HTTP GET to the appropriate query endpoint to pull the data back. Include your \nuser_key\n and \napi_key\n as URL parameters. The query response will contain up to 200 rows from the data set you have requested.\n\n\nBest Practice #1 \u2010 Use the Bulk Output Format\n\n\nFor bulk data pulls, we strongly recommended that you use the \nbulk\n output format, which is highly optimized for performance. The \nbulk\n output format disables functionality which displays additional data in the API response such as nested object relationships (e.g. campaign name for activities, etc.). Additionally, the bulk output format omits information about the total number of rows that matched your query, which enables the API to return a response more quickly.\n\n\nBest Practice #2 \u2010 Avoid Offset\n\n\nFor bulk data pulls, we strongly discourage use of the \noffset\n parameter. Instead, iterate through the data set using one of the supported search filter criteria parameters.\n\n\nTo accomplish this, as you process the query results in your code, store a high water mark value - the largest \nid\n or most recent \ncreated_at\n or \nupdated_at\n value. Then, on your next query, send that high water mark value as the \nid_greater_than\n, \ncreated_after\n, or \nupdated_after\n search filter parameter value.\n\n\nBulk API Request & Response Samples\n\n\nExample Request & Response (XML)\n\n\ncurl https://pi.pardot.com/api/visitorActivity/version/3/do/query?output=bulk \\\n-H \"Authorization: user_key=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef, api_key=fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321\"\n\n\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<rsp stat=\"ok\" version=\"1.0\">\n    <result>\n        <visitor_activity>\n            <id>23807</id>\n            <visitor_id>14692</visitor_id>\n            <prospect_id>621</prospect_id>\n            <type>1</type>\n            <type_name>Email Tracker</type_name>\n            <details>http://www.pardot.com/products/demos/flash-demo.html</details>\n            <email_id>764</email_id>\n            <campaign_id>1</campaign_id>\n            <created_at>2007-08-09 19:29:07</created_at>\n            </visitor_activity> <visitor_activity>\n            <id>23815</id>\n            <visitor_id>14692</visitor_id>\n            <prospect_id>621</prospect_id>\n            <type>1</type>\n            <type_name>Email Tracker</type_name>\n            <details>http://www.pardot.com/products/demos/flash-demo.html</details>\n            <email_id>764</email_id>\n            <campaign_id>1</campaign_id>\n            <created_at>2007-08-09 20:13:40</created_at>\n        </visitor_activity>\n    </result>\n</rsp>\n\n\n\n\nExample Request & Response (JSON)\n\n\ncurl https://pi.pardot.com/api/visitorActivity/version/3/do/query?output=bulk&format=json \\\n-H \"Authorization: user_key=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef, api_key=fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321\"\n\n\n\n\n{\n    \"@attributes\": {\n        \"stat\": \"ok\",\n        \"version\": 1\n    },\n    \"result\": {\n        \"visitor_activity\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 23807,\n            \"visitor_id\": 14692,\n            \"prospect_id\": 621,\n            \"type\": 1,\n            \"type_name\": \"Email Tracker\",\n            \"details\": \"http:\\/\\/www.pardot.com\\/products\\/demos\\/flash-demo.html\",\n            \"email_id\": 764,\n            \"campaign_id\": 1,\n            \"created_at\": \"2007-08-09 19:29:07\"\n        }, {\n            \"id\": 23815,\n            \"visitor_id\": 14692,\n            \"prospect_id\": 621,\n            \"type\": 1,\n            \"type_name\": \"Email Tracker\",\n            \"details\": \"http:\\/\\/www.pardot.com\\/products\\/demos\\/flash-demo.html\",\n            \"email_id\": 764,\n            \"campaign_id\": 1,\n            \"created_at\": \"2007-08-09 20:13:40\"\n        }]\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample of Paging through a Large Set of Results\n\n\nBecause using the offset parameter is strongly discouraged, let\u2019s see how you can use a high water mark value to iterate through multiple pages of results instead.

Prospects can be specified by their Pardot ID or email address. Users or groups can be specified by their Pardot user ID, email address, or Pardot group ID. Possible combinations of parameters are shown below. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by \n<carets>\n.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?user_email=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?user_id=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?group_id=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_email=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_id=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?group_id=\n\n\nXML responses to \nassign\n requests are identical to \nread\n requests, but reflect the new prospect assignment in the \n<assigned_to>\n node.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Prospects\n\n\nTo create a prospect via the API, only a valid and unique email address is required. Values for any other prospect fields may also be provided in the \ncreate\n request. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by \n<carets>\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Creating a new prospect\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/create/email/\nnew_prospect@pardot.com\n?first_name=New&last_name=Prospect\n\n\nXML responses to \ncreate\n requests are identical to \nupdate\n and \nread\n requests. If no \ncampaign_id\n value is provided, the new prospect will be automatically assigned to the oldest existing campaign.\n\n\n\n\nEndpoints for Batch Processing\n\n\nThere are 3 endpoints available for batch processing up to 50 prospects at a time:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchCreate\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpsert\n\n\nThese endpoints expect a query variable called \"prospects\" which holds either JSON or XML encoded data. Each prospect should have a unique identifier which will be used in the return output.\n\n\nJSON Example:\n\n\n{\n    \"prospects\": {\n        \"1234\": {\n            \"first_name\": \"New first name\",\n            \"last_name\": \"New last name\"\n        },\n        \"some@email.com\": {\n            \"first_name\": \"New first name\",\n            \"last_name\": \"New last name\"\n        },\n        \"some.other@email.com\": {\n            \"first_name\": \"New first name\",\n            \"last_name\": \"New last name\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nXML Example:\n\n\n<prospects>\n    <prospect identifier=\"1234\">\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n    <prospect identifier=\"some@email.com\">\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n    <prospect identifier=\"some.other@email.com\">\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n</prospects>\n\n\n\n\nIf using \nbatchCreate\n, you'll need to provide a valid and unique email address for each prospect. The \nbatchUpdate\n and \nbatchUpsert\n endpoints allow the use of a prospect ID or prospect email address.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate?prospects={\"prospects\":{\"some@email.com\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"},\"1234\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"}}}\n\n\nNote:\n The return value will either be XML or JSON (XML by default. If you want JSON, then add \"&format=json\" to your HTTP query).\n\n\nUpdating Field Values\n\n\nModifying values of prospect data fields is done by submitting an \nupdate\n request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as \n<field_name>=<value>\n. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.\n\n\nExample:\n Updating the phone number of a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?phone=888-123-4567\n\n\nOnly values that are specifically named in the request are updated. All others are left unchanged. To clear a value, submit an \nupdate\n request containing a parameter with no specified value, such as \nphone=\n.\n\n\nNote:\n Any field that is set to record multiple responses cannot have its values cleared this way.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Fields with Predefined Values\n\n\nModifying values of prospect data fields with predefined values is accomplished through an \nupdate\n request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as \n<field_name>=<value>\n where \n<value>\n matches the predefined field value. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.\n\n\nExample:\n Updating the category of a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n *to the category \nconsumer\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?category=consumer\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Fields with Multiple Values\n\n\nUpdating field values with multiple values follows the same convention as fields with predefined values, but requires a different parameter naming scheme to allow multiplicity. An \nupdate\n request is submitted with parameters formatted as \n<field_name>_<count>=<field_value>\n where \n<count>\n is an integer denoting the current parameter's place in sequence. \n<count>\n must start at 0 and increase by 1 until all desired values are submitted.\n\n\nExample:\n Modifying the values of a custom field with field name\n \npast_jobs\n \nfor a prospect with a Pardot ID of\n \n5\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/5?past_jobs_0=janitor&past_jobs_1=security\n\n\nNote:\n Checkbox and multi-select fields are the only field types that can be updated in this manner. To clear all of the values for a checkbox or multi-select field, use \n<field_name>_0=\n. To clear specific values, just set the values that should remain in the prospect record using the method above.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Email List Subscriptions\n\n\nTo modify email list subscriptions for a prospect, the Pardot ID of the email list is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nlist_<list_id>=1\n to create a subscription and \nlist_<list_id>=0\n to end a subscription.\n\n\nExample:\n Adding a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n \nto an email list with Pardot ID\n \n8\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?list_8=1\n\n\nRequests that attempt to subscribe a prospect to lists that it is already subscribed to are ignored. Unsubscribe requests are handled similarly.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Profile Criteria Matching Statuses\n\n\nTo modify a prospect's matching status for associated profile criteria, the Pardot ID of the profile criteria is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nprofile_criteria_<profile_criteria_id>=<status>\n. The value of \n<status>\n may be either \nmatch\n, \nnomatch\n, or \nunknown\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a profile criteria for a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n \nto\n \nmatch\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?profile_criteria_8=match\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a profile criteria for a prospect with Pardot ID\n \n58\n \nto\n \nnomatch\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/58?profile_criteria_8=nomatch\n\n\nOnly profile criteria that belong to the profile associated with the prospect can be updated using this method. Requests to update profile criteria not associated with the assigned profile will be ignored. Using any matching status values other than \nmatch\n, \nnomatch\n, or \nunknown\n will result in an error message. See \nError Codes & Messages\n for details.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Prospect Account Associations\n\n\nTo modify a prospect's matching status for associated prospect account, the Pardot ID of the prospect account is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nprospect_account_id=<id>\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a prospect account for a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n \nto\n \nmatch\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?prospect_account_id=\n\n\nA prospect account with the id must exist, and can not be set if a CRM connector is set up in the account.",

Prospects can be specified by their Pardot ID or CRM FID. Users or groups can be specified by their Pardot user ID, email address, or Pardot group ID. Possible combinations of parameters are shown below. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by \n<carets>\n.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/assign/id/?user_email\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/assign/id/?user_id\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/assign/id/?group_id\n\n\nXML responses to \nassign\n requests are identical to \nread\n requests, but reflect the new prospect assignment in the \n<assigned_to>\n node.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Prospects\n\n\nTo create a prospect via the API, only a valid email address is required. Values for any other prospect fields may also be provided in the \ncreate\n request. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by \n<carets>\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Creating a new prospect\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/create/email/new_prospect@pardot.com?first_name=New&last_name=Prospect\n\n\nXML responses to \ncreate\n requests are identical to \nupdate\n and \nread\n requests. If no \ncampaign_id\n value is provided, the new prospect will be automatically assigned to the oldest existing campaign.\n\n\nUpserting Prospects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pardot Prospect Upsert API can be used to create, update, or unarchive/update prospects in your account. Whether your call to the Upsert API will result in prospect creation, update, or unarchive/update depends on the parameters given in the request, and whether they match corresponding prospects already in your account. The following rules govern the behavior of the upsert API:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf ID and/or FID parameters are included in the request and they match an existing prospect in your account, that prospect will be updated with the given information. If the matching prospect is archived, it will be unarchived, and then have the updates applied to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an email address is provided in the request, but ID and FID are not given, a prospect will be created with the given email address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an email address and an FID are provided in the request, a prospect will be created with the given email address/FID combination, so long as no prospect already exists in the account with the same FID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFields that are not updated by the request remain unchanged. Email list subscriptions and custom field data may also be updated with this request. Refer to the \nUpdating Email List Subscriptions\n and \nUpdating Field Values\n sections for more details. Returns an updated version of the prospect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndpoints for Batch Processing\n\n\nThere are 3 endpoints available for batch processing up to 50 prospects at a time:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/batchCreate\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/batchUpdate\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/batchUpsert\n\n\nThese endpoints expect a query variable called \"prospects\" which holds either JSON or XML encoded data.\n\n\nJSON Create Example:\n\n\n{\n    \"prospects\": [\n        {\"email\":\"some@email.com\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"},\n        {\"email\":\"some@email.com\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"},\n        {\"email\":\"some@email.com\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nXML Create Example:\n\n\n<prospects>\n    <prospect>\n        <email>some@email.com</email>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n    <prospect>\n        <email>some@email.com</email>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n    <prospect>\n        <email>some2@email.com</email>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n</prospects>\n\n\n\n\nJSON Upsert Example\n\n\n{\n    \"prospects\": [\n        {\"email\":\"some@email.com\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"},\n        {\"fid\":\"1234\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"},\n        {\"id\":\"10\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nXML Upsert Example:\n\n\n<prospects>\n    <prospect>\n        <email>some@email.com</email>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n    <prospect>\n        <fid>1234</fid>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n    <prospect>\n        <id>10</id>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n</prospects>\n\n\n\n\nJSON Update Example\n\n\n{\n    \"prospects\": [\n        {\"fid\":\"1234\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"},\n        {\"id\":\"10\",\"first_name\":\"First name\",\"last_name\":\"Last name\"}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nXML Update Example:\n\n\n<prospects>\n    <prospect>\n        <fid>1234</fid>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n    <prospect>\n        <id>10</id>\n        <first_name>New first name</first_name>\n        <last_name>New last name</last_name>\n    </prospect>\n</prospects>\n\n\n\n\nIf using \nbatchCreate\n, you'll need to provide a valid email address for each prospect.\n\n\nThe \nbatchUpsert\n endpoint allows the use of prospect IDs and CRM FIDs as valid record identifiers. If the request includes an email address but no ID or CRM FID, a prospect will be created with the email address. \n\n\nThe \nbatchUpdate\n endpoint allows the use of prospect IDs and CRM FIDs.  Updating by prospect Email Address is not supported - a prospect ID or CRM FID is required as a valid record identifier.  You may query by email address to get record identifiers.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/4/do/batchUpdate?prospects={\"prospects\":{\"1337\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"},\"1234\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"}}}\n\n\nNote:\n The return value will either be XML or JSON (XML by default. If you want JSON, then add \"&format=json\" to your HTTP query).\n\n\nNote:\n If any errors are found during the batch process, an error array will be returned for only the prospects with issues. The error array will be key/value pairs where the key is the index of the prospect submitted in the request. All other prospects will be processed as expected.\n\n\nUpdating Field Values\n\n\nModifying values of prospect data fields is done by submitting an \nupdate\n request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as \n<field_name>=<value>\n. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.\n\n\nExample:\n Updating the phone number of a prospect whose Pardot ID is\n \n300\n: /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/300?phone=888-123-4567\n\n\nOnly values that are specifically named in the request are updated. All others are left unchanged. To clear a value, submit an \nupdate\n request containing a parameter with no specified value, such as \nphone=\n.\n\n\nNote:\n Any field that is set to record multiple responses cannot have its values cleared this way.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Fields with Predefined Values\n\n\nModifying values of prospect data fields with predefined values is accomplished through an \nupdate\n request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as \n<field_name>=<value>\n where \n<value>\n matches the predefined field value. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.\n\n\nExample:\n Updating the category of a prospect whose Pardot ID is\n \n300\n *to the category \nconsumer\n: /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/300?category=consumer\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Fields with Multiple Values\n\n\nUpdating field values with multiple values follows the same convention as fields with predefined values, but requires a different parameter naming scheme to allow multiplicity. An \nupdate\n request is submitted with parameters formatted as \n<field_name>_<count>=<field_value>\n where \n<count>\n is an integer denoting the current parameter's place in sequence. \n<count>\n must start at 0 and increase by 1 until all desired values are submitted.\n\n\nExample:\n Modifying the values of a custom field with field name\n \npast_jobs\n \nfor a prospect with a Pardot ID of\n \n5\n: /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/5?past_jobs_0=janitor&past_jobs_1=security\n\n\nNote:\n Checkbox and multi-select fields are the only field types that can be updated in this manner. To clear all of the values for a checkbox or multi-select field, use \n<field_name>_0=\n. To clear specific values, just set the values that should remain in the prospect record using the method above.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Email List Subscriptions\n\n\nTo modify email list subscriptions for a prospect, the Pardot ID of the email list is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nlist_<list_id>=1\n to create a subscription and \nlist_<list_id>=0\n to end a subscription.\n\n\nExample:\n Adding a prospect whose Pardot ID is\n \n300\n \nto an email list with Pardot ID\n 8`: /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/300?list_8=1\n\n\nRequests that attempt to subscribe a prospect to lists that it is already subscribed to are ignored. Unsubscribe requests are handled similarly.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Profile Criteria Matching Statuses\n\n\nTo modify a prospect's matching status for associated profile criteria, the Pardot ID of the profile criteria is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nprofile_criteria_<profile_criteria_id>=<status>\n. The value of \n<status>\n may be either \nmatch\n, \nnomatch\n, or \nunknown\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a profile criteria for a prospect with Pardot ID\n \n58\n \nto\n \nmatch\n: /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/58?profile_criteria_8=match\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a profile criteria for a prospect with Pardot ID\n \n58\n \nto\n \nnomatch\n: /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/58?profile_criteria_8=nomatch\n\n\nOnly profile criteria that belong to the profile associated with the prospect can be updated using this method. Requests to update profile criteria not associated with the assigned profile will be ignored. Using any matching status values other than \nmatch\n, \nnomatch\n, or \nunknown\n will result in an error message. See \nError Codes & Messages\n for details.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Prospect Account Associations\n\n\nTo modify a prospect's matching status for associated prospect account, the Pardot ID of the prospect account is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nprospect_account_id=<id>\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a prospect account for a prospect whose Pardot ID is\n \n300\n \nto\n \nmatch\n: /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/300?prospect_account_id=\n\n\nA prospect account with the id must exist, and can not be set if a CRM connector is set up in the account.",
