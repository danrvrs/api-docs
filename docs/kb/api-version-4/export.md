# Export API Overview

The Export API provides a way to retrieve large volumes of data from Pardot. It uses Pardot's existing API structures, patterns, and terminology.

# When to Use the Export API

Use the Export API to retrieve large sets of data when you don't need synchronous completion responses or when query limitations are too restrictive. Currently, only visitor activity is supported.

# How the Export API Works

An export is associated with a query and a data set in Pardot. When you create an export, the query is split into smaller queries, which return smaller sets of data. These smaller queries are processed in parallel, and the retrieved data is saved in CSV files. When the export is complete, the CSV files are available to download.

The order of the records returned in the CSV files is not guaranteed. The number of records in each CSV file varies, and all of the files associated with an export make up the full data set for the query.

The Export resource is used to create an export and get the status of an export. When the export is complete, the links to the CSV files containing the data are available in the resource.

# Limitations

* The Export API is subject to the daily Pardot API call limit and the concurrent Pardot API call limit for your account.
* Export API calls are executed sequentially for each account, with older exports being processed before newer exports.
* Export API currently only supports exports of up to 12 months of data per call.

# Expiration

The data associated with an export expires after 7 days. When data expires, the Export resource removes links to the CSV files and shows that the export has expired. Attempts to retrieve the data after an export expires fail.

# CSV File Formatting

* The first row contains the name of the field.
* The second row and beyond contain the record data.
* Dates are returned in the user’s timezone at the time they created the export.
    * For example, if a user is in “PST” timezone and creates an export, the dates in the export are in “PST”. If a second user is in “EST” timezone and downloads the exported files, the dates in the export are in “PST”.
    * If a user’s timezone changes, previous exports created by the user have dates formatted in the previous timezone. Dates in new exports use the new timezone.
* Dates are returned in the standard Pardot API date format of `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS`.
* Fields with null values are represented as an empty value in CSV.

# Procedures

A procedure is a query and execution plan used to retrieve the data. Each object has a different set of procedures.

## Visitor Activity

### Fields

Select the visitor activity fields that need to be exported. [Following](../../object-field-references/#visitor-activity) are the fields that are available for visitor activity. The value for `fields` must be an array of strings of the available fields. 

### filter_by_created_at

Retrieves all visitor activity records with a `created_at` value that is equal or greater than the `created_after` argument and less than or equal to the `created_before` argument.

#### Abilities

| Action           | Requirements  |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Create export    | Prospects > Visitors > View ability |
| View export      | Prospects > Visitors > View ability and be the same user that created the export |
| View all exports | Admin > Exports > View ability |
| Query exports    | Admin > Exports > View ability |


To create an export with this procedure, the user must have the following:

* “Prospects > Visitors > View“ ability

To view an export with this procedure, the user must have the following:

* “Prospects > Visitors > View“ ability AND
* The user must be the same as the user that created the export

OR

* “Admin > Exports > View”

#### Arguments

* **created_after**: Selects visitor activities that were created after the specified time. The value can be `today`, `yesterday`, `last_7_days`, `this_month`, `last_month`, or a custom time specified in [GNU Date Input Syntax](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Date-input-formats.html) format.
* **created_before**: (Optional) Selects visitor activities that were created before the specified time. This value must be after the value in `created_after`. If this argument is not specified, then no upper boundary is used in the query, and all data after the `created_after` is returned. The value can be `today`, `yesterday`, `last_7_days`, `this_month`, `last_month`, or a custom time specified in [GNU Date Input Syntax](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Date-input-formats.html) format.
* **type**: (Optional) Selects visitor activities of the specified types. If this argument is not specified, then all of the visitor activities belonging to any type is returned. See a list of available [Visitor Activity Types](../object-field-references.md#visitor-activity-types) in [Visitor Activity](../object-field-references.md#visitor-activity) in [Object Field References](../object-field-references.md).
* **prospectOnly**: (Optional) Selects only those visitor activities associated with a prospect. When this field is set to `false`, all visitor activities with and without a prospect are returned. The values can be `true` or `false`.

__NOTE:__ The range between created_after and created_before cannot exceed 1 year. When created_before is not specified, the current date is used to gauge the interval.

# Using the Export API

---

## POST

### Request Body

Content-Type must be `application/json`.

Input Representation

* **object**: Specifies which object to export. Currently only "visitorActivity" is supported.
* **fields**: Specifies the fields that will be exported. If no `fields` value is given, all available fields will be exported.
* **procedure**: The procedure to execute. A procedure is a query and execution plan used to retrieve data. Each object has a different set of procedures. See the [Procedures](#procedures) section for available procedures.
    * **name**: The name of the procedure.
    * **arguments**: Arguments used to manipulate the behavior of the procedure. These arguments are specific to the procedure. See the documentation for the procedure to see which arguments apply.

```

### Errors

* Status Code: 4xx
* Error codes: See [Error Codes](../error-codes-messages.md)

### Example

This is a request to execute the visitor activity procedure named `filter_by_created_at`, which retrieves all visitor activity data where the `created_at` value is between two dates. In this example, the data will be retrieved from December 25, 2019 to December 25, 2020.

```
POST /api/export/version/4/do/create
HOST: pi.pardot.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Pardot user_key=U,api_key=A
```

```json
{
    "object": "visitorActivity",
    "fields": ["id", "prospect_id", "visitor_id", "type_name", "created_at"],
    "procedure": {
        "name": "filter_by_created_at",
        "arguments": {
            "created_after": "2019-12-25 10:00:00",

        }
    }
}
```

After sending the request as a `POST`, the response will be the following. From this response, the export has been queued for execution but has not started nor completed. We suggest waiting a few minutes before checking the Read endpoint for the new status.

```json
{
    "id": 201917,
    "state": "Waiting",
    "isExpired": false
}
```
